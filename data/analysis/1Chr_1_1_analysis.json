  "ai_explanation": "What a great choice!\n\nVerse: אָדָ֥ם שֵׁ֖ת אֱנֽוֹשׁ׃ (Adam, Sheth, Enosh)\n\n**English Translation:** \"Man, Seth, Enosh\"\n\n**Key Hebrew Words Explanation:**\n\n1. **אָדָ֥ם (Adam)**: The first man created by God (Genesis 2:7).\n2. **שֵׁ֖ת (Sheth)**: A name that means \"appointed\" or \"placed\" (Genesis 5:3). Seth is the third son of Adam and Eve, considered a righteous person.\n3. **אֱנֽוֹשׁ (Enosh)**: A name that means \"mortal man\" or \"human being\" (Genesis 4:26).\n\n**Grammar Insight:** This verse demonstrates the use of a Hebrew construct phrase, where two nouns are joined together using the preposition שֵׁ (sheth). In this case, it's equivalent to saying \"Man Seth Enosh\", emphasizing the connection between these three individuals. Construct phrases are common in biblical Hebrew and often convey relationships or categorizations.\n\nIn summary, this verse lists three names that represent different stages of human history: Adam (the original creation), Sheth (a righteous individual), and Enosh (mortal man).",
